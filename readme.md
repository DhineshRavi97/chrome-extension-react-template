This is a simple chrome extension template built to avoid lengthy setup process for creating a new chrome extension. This requires node.js and npm. To use this template:

1. Install node.js and npm if not installed already
2. Clone this repository inside the project folder or copy the files downloaded to the project folder
3. Open terminal and cd to the project folder
4. Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies
5. For dev builds, run "npm run dev" and for production builds, run "npm run build"
6. Open chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
7. Enable developer mode if not enabled already
8. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the dist folder from the project folder

Please note that this template is only for building chrome extensions which shall is supported only by chromium based browsers.

Happy hacking!!
